- 👋 Hi, I’m @PAS2024
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Engineering!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PySpark and R to tackle big data challenges.

- 📫 How to reach me through DM on Github.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know the average data pipeline a data engineer builds can move petabytes (a million gigabytes) of data per day? That's an amount of information so vast it would take a single person years to even download!.
